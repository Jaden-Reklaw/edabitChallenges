/*
Reverse the Number
Create a function that takes an integer n and reverses it.

Examples
rev(5121) ➞ "1215"

rev(69) ➞ "96"

rev(-122157) ➞ "751221"
Notes
This challenge is about using two operators that are related to division.
If the number is negative, treat it like it's positive.

//My answer
const rev = n => String(Math.abs(n)).split('').reverse().join('');
